A Miserable Pile of Coefficients! </a></h1> <p>Linear algebra is undoubtedly the most useful field in all of algebra. It finds applications in all kinds of science and engineering, like quantum mechanics, graphics programming, and machine learning. It is the “most well-behaved” algebraic theory, in that other abstract algebra topics often try to approximate linear algebra, when possible.</p> <p>For many students, linear algebra means vectors and matrices and determinants, and complex formulas for computing them. Matrices, in particular, come equipped with a fairly complicated, and <em>a fortiori</em> convoluted, multiplication operation.</p> <p>This is not the only way to teach linear algebra, of course. Matrices and their multiplication appear complicated, but actually are a natural and compact way to represent a particular type of <em>function</em>, i.e., a linear map (or linear transformation).</p> <p>This article is a short introduction to viewing linear algebra from the perspective of abstract algebra, from which matrices arise as a computational tool, rather than an object of study in and of themselves. I do assume some degree of familiarity with the idea of a matrix.</p> <h2 id="linear-spaces"><a href="#linear-spaces">Linear Spaces</a></h2> <p>Most linear algebra courses open with a description of vectors in Euclidean space: $\R^n$. Vectors there are defined as tuples of real numbers that can be added, multiplied, and scaled. Two vectors can be combined into a number through the dot product. Vectors come equipped with a notion of magnitude and direction.</p> <p>However, this highly geometric picture can be counterproductive, since it is hard to apply geometric intuition directly to higher dimensions. It also obscures how this connects to working over a different number system, like the complex numbers.</p> <p>Instead, I’d like to open with the concept of a <em>linear space</em>, which is somewhat more abstract than a vector space<sup id="fnref:vs-in-generality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vs-in-generality" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <p>First, we will need a notion of a “coefficient”, which is essentially something that you can do arithmetic with. We will draw coefficients from a designated <em>ground field</em> $K$. A field is a setting for doing arithmetic: a set of objects that can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, and divided in the “usual fashion” along with special $0$ and $1$ values. E.g. $a + 0 = a$, $1a = a$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$, and so on.</p> <p>Not only are the real numbers $\R$ a field, but so are the complex numbers $\C$, and the rational numbers $\Q$. If we drop the “division” requirement, we can also include the integers $\Z$, or polynomials with rational coefficients $\Q[x]$, for example.</p> <p>Having chosen our coefficients $K$, a linear space $V$ <em>over</em> $K$ is another set of objects that can be added and subtracted (and including a special value $0$)<sup id="fnref:ab-group" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ab-group" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, along with a <em>scaling operation</em>, which takes a coefficient $c \in K$ and one of our objects $v \in V$ and produces a new $cv \in V$.</p> <p>The important part of the scaling operation is that it’s compatible with addition: if we have $a, b \in K$ and $v, w \in V$, we require that</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}a (v + w) = av + aw \\ (a + b) v = av + bv\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>This is what makes a linear space “linear”: you can write equations that look like first-degree polynomials (e.g. $ax + b$), and which can be <em>manipulated like first-degree polynomials</em>.</p> <p>These polynomials are called linear because their graph looks like a line. There’s no multiplication, so we can’t have $x^2$, but we do have multiplication by a coefficient. This is what makes linear algebra is “linear”.</p> <p>Some examples: $n$-tuples of elements drawn from any field are a linear space over that field, by componentwise addition and scalar multiplication; e.g., $R^3$. Setting $n = 1$ shows that every field is a linear space over itself.</p> <p>Polynomials in one variable over some field, $K[x]$, are also a linear space, since polynomials can be added together and scaled by a any value in $K$ (since lone coefficients are degree zero polynomials). Real-valued functions also form a linear space over $\R$ in a similar way.</p> <h3 id="linear-transformations"><a href="#linear-transformations">Linear Transformations</a></h3> <p>A linear map is a function $f: V \to W$ between two linear spaces $V$ and $W$ over $K$ which “respects” the linear structure in a particular way. That is, for any $c\in K$ and $v, w \in V$,</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}f(v + w) = f(v) + f(w) \\ f(cv) = c \cdot f(v)\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>We call this type of relationship (respecting addition and scaling) “linearity”. One way to think of this relationship is that $f$ is kind of like a different kind of coefficient, in that it distributes over addition, which commutes with the “ordinary” coefficients from $K$. However, applying $f$ produces a value from $W$ rather than $V$.</p> <p>Another way to think of it is that if we have a linear polynomial like $p(x) = ax + b$ in $x$, then $f(p(x)) = p(f(x))$. We say that $f$ <em>commutes</em> with all linear polynomials.</p> <p>The most obvious sort of linear map is scaling. Given any coefficient $c \in K$, it defines a “scaling map”:</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}\mu_c: V \to V \\ v \mapsto cv\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>It’s trivial to check this is a linear map, by plugging it into the above equations: it’s linear because scaling is distributive and commutative.</p> <p>Linear maps are the essential thing we study in linear algebra, since they describe all the different kinds of relationships between linear spaces.</p> <p>Some linear maps are complicated. For example, a function from $\R^2 \to \R^2$ that rotates the plane by some angle $\theta$ is linear, as are operations that stretch or shear the plane. However, they can’t “bend” or “fold” the plane: they are all fairly rigid motions. In the linear space $\Q[x]$ of rational polynomials, multiplication by <em>any</em> polynomial, such as $x$ or $x^2 - 1$, is a linear map. The notion of “linear map” depends heavily on the space we’re in.</p> <p>Unfortunately, linear maps as they are quite opaque, and do not lend themselves well to calculation. However, we can build an explicit representation using a <em>linear basis</em>.</p> <h2 id="linear-basis"><a href="#linear-basis">Linear Basis</a></h2> <p>For any linear space, we can construct a relatively small of elements such that any element of the space can be expressed as some linear function of these elements.</p> <p>Explicitly, for any $V$, we can construct a sequence<sup id="fnref:indices" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:indices" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> $e_i$ such that for any $v \in V$, we can find $c_i \in K$ such that</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[v = \sum_i c_i e_i.\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>Such a set $e_i$ is called a <em>basis</em> if it is linearly independent: no one $e_i$ can be expressed as a linear function of the rest. The <em>dimension</em> of $V$, denoted $\dim V$, is the number of elements in any choice of basis. This value does not depend on the choice of basis<sup id="fnref:invariant-dim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:invariant-dim" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>Constructing a basis for any $V$ is easy: we can do this recursively. First, pick a random element $e_1$ of $V$, and define a new linear space $V/e_1$ where we have identified all elements that differ by a factor of $e_1$ as equal (i.e., if $v - w = ce_1$, we treat $v$ and $w$ as equal in $V/e_1$).</p> <p>Then, a basis for $V$ is a basis of $V/e_1$ with $e_1$ added. The construction of $V/e_1$ is essentially “collapsing” the dimension $e_1$ “points” in, giving us a new space where we’ve “deleted” all of the elements that have a nonzero $e_1$ component.</p> <p>However, this only works when the dimension is finite; more complex methods must be used for infinite-dimensional spaces. For example, the polynomials $\Q[x]$ are an infinite-dimensional space, with basis elements $\{1, x, x^2, x^3, …\}$. In general, for any linear space $V$, it <em>is</em> always possible to arbitrarily choose a basis, although it may be infinite<sup id="fnref:rq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rq" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p> <p>Bases are useful because they give us a concrete representation of any element of $V$. Given a fixed basis $e_i$, we can represent any $w = \sum_i c_i e_i$ by the coefficients $c_i$ themselves. For a finite-dimensional $V$, this brings us back <em>column vectors</em>: $(\dim V)$-tuples of coefficients from $K$ that are added and scaled componentwise.</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\Mat{c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n} \,\underset{\text{given } e_i}{:=}\, \sum_i c_i e_i\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>The $i$th basis element is represented as the vector whose entries are all $0$ except for the $i$th one, which is $1$. E.g.,</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\Mat{1 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0} \,\underset{\text{given } e_i}{=}\, e_1, \,\,\, \Mat{0 \\ 1 \\ \vdots \\ 0} \,\underset{\text{given } e_i}{=}\, e_2, \,\,\, ...\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>It is important to recall that the choice of basis is <em>arbitrary</em>. From the mathematical perspective, any basis is just as good as any other, although some may be more computationally convenient.</p> <p>Over $\R^2$, $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ are sometimes called the “standard basis”, but $(1, 2)$ and $(3, -4)$ are also a basis for this space. One easy mistake to make, particularly when working over the tuple space $K^n$, is to confuse the actual elements of the linear space with the coefficient vectors that represent them. Working with abstract linear spaces eliminates this source of confusion.</p> <h3 id="representing-linear-transformations"><a href="#representing-linear-transformations">Representing Linear Transformations</a></h3> <p>Working with finite-dimensional linear spaces $V$ and $W$, let’s choose bases $e_i$ and $d_j$ for them, and let’s consider a linear map $f: V \to W$.</p> <p>The powerful thing about bases is that we can more compactly express the information content of $f$. Given any $v \in V$, we can decompose it into a linear function of the basis (for some coefficients), so we can write</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[f(v) = f\left(\sum_i c_i e_i\right) = \sum_i f(c_i e_i) = \sum_i c_i \cdot f(e_i)\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>In other words, to specify $f$, we <em>only</em> need to specify what it does to each of the $\dim V$ basis elements.

The values of the coefficients depend on the choice of basis.</p> <p>If your linear space happens to be $\R^n$, there is an “obvious” choice of basis, but not every linear space over $\R$ is $\R^n$!

A Miserable Pile of Coefficients! </a></h1> <p>Linear algebra is undoubtedly the most useful field in all of algebra. It finds applications in all kinds of science and engineering, like quantum mechanics, graphics programming, and machine learning. It is the “most well-behaved” algebraic theory, in that other abstract algebra topics often try to approximate linear algebra, when possible.</p> <p>For many students, linear algebra means vectors and matrices and determinants, and complex formulas for computing them. Matrices, in particular, come equipped with a fairly complicated, and <em>a fortiori</em> convoluted, multiplication operation.</p> <p>This is not the only way to teach linear algebra, of course. Matrices and their multiplication appear complicated, but actually are a natural and compact way to represent a particular type of <em>function</em>, i.e., a linear map (or linear transformation).</p> <p>This article is a short introduction to viewing linear algebra from the perspective of abstract algebra, from which matrices arise as a computational tool, rather than an object of study in and of themselves. I do assume some degree of familiarity with the idea of a matrix.</p> <h2 id="linear-spaces"><a href="#linear-spaces">Linear Spaces</a></h2> <p>Most linear algebra courses open with a description of vectors in Euclidean space: $\R^n$. Vectors there are defined as tuples of real numbers that can be added, multiplied, and scaled. Two vectors can be combined into a number through the dot product. Vectors come equipped with a notion of magnitude and direction.</p> <p>However, this highly geometric picture can be counterproductive, since it is hard to apply geometric intuition directly to higher dimensions. It also obscures how this connects to working over a different number system, like the complex numbers.</p> <p>Instead, I’d like to open with the concept of a <em>linear space</em>, which is somewhat more abstract than a vector space<sup id="fnref:vs-in-generality" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vs-in-generality" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p> <p>First, we will need a notion of a “coefficient”, which is essentially something that you can do arithmetic with. We will draw coefficients from a designated <em>ground field</em> $K$. A field is a setting for doing arithmetic: a set of objects that can be added, subtracted, and multiplied, and divided in the “usual fashion” along with special $0$ and $1$ values. E.g. $a + 0 = a$, $1a = a$, $a(b + c) = ab + ac$, and so on.</p> <p>Not only are the real numbers $\R$ a field, but so are the complex numbers $\C$, and the rational numbers $\Q$. If we drop the “division” requirement, we can also include the integers $\Z$, or polynomials with rational coefficients $\Q[x]$, for example.</p> <p>Having chosen our coefficients $K$, a linear space $V$ <em>over</em> $K$ is another set of objects that can be added and subtracted (and including a special value $0$)<sup id="fnref:ab-group" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ab-group" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, along with a <em>scaling operation</em>, which takes a coefficient $c \in K$ and one of our objects $v \in V$ and produces a new $cv \in V$.</p> <p>The important part of the scaling operation is that it’s compatible with addition: if we have $a, b \in K$ and $v, w \in V$, we require that</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}a (v + w) = av + aw \\ (a + b) v = av + bv\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>This is what makes a linear space “linear”: you can write equations that look like first-degree polynomials (e.g. $ax + b$), and which can be <em>manipulated like first-degree polynomials</em>.</p> <p>These polynomials are called linear because their graph looks like a line. There’s no multiplication, so we can’t have $x^2$, but we do have multiplication by a coefficient. This is what makes linear algebra is “linear”.</p> <p>Some examples: $n$-tuples of elements drawn from any field are a linear space over that field, by componentwise addition and scalar multiplication; e.g., $R^3$. Setting $n = 1$ shows that every field is a linear space over itself.</p> <p>Polynomials in one variable over some field, $K[x]$, are also a linear space, since polynomials can be added together and scaled by a any value in $K$ (since lone coefficients are degree zero polynomials). Real-valued functions also form a linear space over $\R$ in a similar way.</p> <h3 id="linear-transformations"><a href="#linear-transformations">Linear Transformations</a></h3> <p>A linear map is a function $f: V \to W$ between two linear spaces $V$ and $W$ over $K$ which “respects” the linear structure in a particular way. That is, for any $c\in K$ and $v, w \in V$,</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}f(v + w) = f(v) + f(w) \\ f(cv) = c \cdot f(v)\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>We call this type of relationship (respecting addition and scaling) “linearity”. One way to think of this relationship is that $f$ is kind of like a different kind of coefficient, in that it distributes over addition, which commutes with the “ordinary” coefficients from $K$. However, applying $f$ produces a value from $W$ rather than $V$.</p> <p>Another way to think of it is that if we have a linear polynomial like $p(x) = ax + b$ in $x$, then $f(p(x)) = p(f(x))$. We say that $f$ <em>commutes</em> with all linear polynomials.</p> <p>The most obvious sort of linear map is scaling. Given any coefficient $c \in K$, it defines a “scaling map”:</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\begin{gather*}\mu_c: V \to V \\ v \mapsto cv\end{gather*}\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>It’s trivial to check this is a linear map, by plugging it into the above equations: it’s linear because scaling is distributive and commutative.</p> <p>Linear maps are the essential thing we study in linear algebra, since they describe all the different kinds of relationships between linear spaces.</p> <p>Some linear maps are complicated. For example, a function from $\R^2 \to \R^2$ that rotates the plane by some angle $\theta$ is linear, as are operations that stretch or shear the plane. However, they can’t “bend” or “fold” the plane: they are all fairly rigid motions. In the linear space $\Q[x]$ of rational polynomials, multiplication by <em>any</em> polynomial, such as $x$ or $x^2 - 1$, is a linear map. The notion of “linear map” depends heavily on the space we’re in.</p> <p>Unfortunately, linear maps as they are quite opaque, and do not lend themselves well to calculation. However, we can build an explicit representation using a <em>linear basis</em>.</p> <h2 id="linear-basis"><a href="#linear-basis">Linear Basis</a></h2> <p>For any linear space, we can construct a relatively small of elements such that any element of the space can be expressed as some linear function of these elements.</p> <p>Explicitly, for any $V$, we can construct a sequence<sup id="fnref:indices" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:indices" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> $e_i$ such that for any $v \in V$, we can find $c_i \in K$ such that</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[v = \sum_i c_i e_i.\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>Such a set $e_i$ is called a <em>basis</em> if it is linearly independent: no one $e_i$ can be expressed as a linear function of the rest. The <em>dimension</em> of $V$, denoted $\dim V$, is the number of elements in any choice of basis. This value does not depend on the choice of basis<sup id="fnref:invariant-dim" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:invariant-dim" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p> <p>Constructing a basis for any $V$ is easy: we can do this recursively. First, pick a random element $e_1$ of $V$, and define a new linear space $V/e_1$ where we have identified all elements that differ by a factor of $e_1$ as equal (i.e., if $v - w = ce_1$, we treat $v$ and $w$ as equal in $V/e_1$).</p> <p>Then, a basis for $V$ is a basis of $V/e_1$ with $e_1$ added. The construction of $V/e_1$ is essentially “collapsing” the dimension $e_1$ “points” in, giving us a new space where we’ve “deleted” all of the elements that have a nonzero $e_1$ component.</p> <p>However, this only works when the dimension is finite; more complex methods must be used for infinite-dimensional spaces. For example, the polynomials $\Q[x]$ are an infinite-dimensional space, with basis elements $\{1, x, x^2, x^3, …\}$. In general, for any linear space $V$, it <em>is</em> always possible to arbitrarily choose a basis, although it may be infinite<sup id="fnref:rq" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rq" class="footnote" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>.</p> <p>Bases are useful because they give us a concrete representation of any element of $V$. Given a fixed basis $e_i$, we can represent any $w = \sum_i c_i e_i$ by the coefficients $c_i$ themselves. For a finite-dimensional $V$, this brings us back <em>column vectors</em>: $(\dim V)$-tuples of coefficients from $K$ that are added and scaled componentwise.</p> <div class="codeblock"><div class="latex-pre">\[\Mat{c_0 \\ c_1 \\ \vdots \\ c_n} \,\underset{\text{given } e_i}{:=}\, \sum_i c_i e_i\]</div><div class="codeblock-buttons"><div class="codeblock-button">Math</div></div></div> <p>The $i$th basis element is represented as the vector whose entries are all $0$ except for the $i$th one, which is $1$.

From the mathematical perspective, any basis is just as good as any other, although some may be more computationally convenient.</p> <p>Over $\R^2$, $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$ are sometimes called the “standard basis”, but $(1, 2)$ and $(3, -4)$ are also a basis for this space. One easy mistake to make, particularly when working over the tuple space $K^n$, is to confuse the actual elements of the linear space with the coefficient vectors that represent them. Working with abstract linear spaces eliminates this source of confusion.</p> <h3 id="representing-linear-transformations"><a href="#representing-linear-transformations">Representing Linear Transformations</a></h3> <p>Working with finite-dimensional linear spaces $V$ and $W$, let’s choose bases $e_i$ and $d_j$ for them, and let’s consider a linear map $f: V \to W$.</p> <p>The powerful thing about bases is that we can more compactly express the information content of $f$.
